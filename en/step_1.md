- Raspberry Pi computer
- Components:
  - 3x LEDs and resistors
  - Button
  - Buzzer
  - Breadboard
  - Jumper wires
- Alternatively, use a Traffic HAT (or a pi-stop instead of the LEDs) - and use different pin numbers

You'll need to install Mu. Open a Terminal window and type the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install mu-editor
```

If you need to print this project we have PDF versions for connecting LEDs or a pi-stop: 
+ [LEDs](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/jam-worksheets/raw/master/pdf/Traffic-Lights-Python.pdf). 
+ [Pi-stop - page 1 only](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/jam-worksheets/raw/master/pdf/Interactive-Traffic-Lights-Python.pdf).*

Please observe any notes on this page before printing.

* page 2 of the pi-stop PDF covers creating a [Traffic lights controller GUI](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/traffic-lights-controller-gui){:target="_blank"}.
